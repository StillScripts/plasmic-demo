This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project using [Plasmic](https://www.plasmic.app/) for components. 

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The homepage is contained in `pages/index.tsx`. This page demonstrates the integration of a Plasmic component into a page that is using simple CSS for the rest of its elements.

A full page demo is contained in `pages/plasmic.tsx`. This uses a Plasmic page for all the content on the page. 

The design I created in Plasmic is based on this [Apple page](https://www.apple.com/au/iphone-13-pro/)
